## Getting started

### Editing

The only file you should need to edit is index.html. There is a 
bunch of references and configuration at the top of the index.html - 
ignore that. The narrative content currently starts around line 653. 

What you can do is check the github repository out or download it, open the 
index.html in a text editor (emacs, sublime, notepad++ etc), make 
changes, save, and then view them by opening the file in my web browser.

But you can also directly edit using the github editor by clicking on the tiny
pen when on the file you want to edit.

The report is using a javascript editing library called ReSpec. The 
complete documentation is here: https://github.com/w3c/respec/wiki

Ideally you want to send your changes as pull requests (so fork the repository
and edit in your fork), or inside a branch to facilitate integration of the changes.

### Adding comments

A simple way for you to make to make an editing comment in the HTML 
that I will see and address would be this:
```html
    <aside><b>COMMENT: some comment about the first paragraph</b></aside>
```
### Issues

Substantial issues in the spec can be reported as issues on github. 
This is nice because ReSpec provides a simple mechanism for tying 
comments to github issues and making it very evidence in the report -
