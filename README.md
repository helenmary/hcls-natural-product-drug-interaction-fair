## Getting started

### Editing

The only file you should need to edit is index.html. There is a 
bunch of references and configuration at the top of the index.html - 
ignore that. The narrative content currently starts around line 653. 
What I do is check the github repository out or download it, open the 
index.html in a text editor (emacs, sublime, notepad++ etc), make 
changes, save, and then view them by opening the file in my web browser.

The report is using a javascript editing library called ReSpec. The 
complete documentation is here: https://github.com/w3c/respec/wiki

Ideally you want to send your changes as pull requests (so fork the repository
and edit in your fork), or inside a branch to facilitate integration of the changes.

### Adding comments

A simple way for you to make to make an editing comment in the HTML 
that I will see and address would be this:

     <aside><b>COMMENT: some comment about the first paragraph</b></aside>

### Issues

Substantial issues in the spec can be reported as issues on github. 
This is nice because ReSpec provides a simple mechanism for tying 
comments to github issues and making it very evidence in the report - 
see 
https://github.com/w3c/respec/wiki/Referencing-GitHub-issues-in-your-spec 
E.g., in the current note, there are two issues in the abstract section 
- one on deciding editor/author roles and ordering and the other 
indicating that the abstract will be completed after the report is fully 
drafted.
